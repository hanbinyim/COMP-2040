# Question 1: Basic Conditions
#You are given a variable x with a value of 15. Write a Python program that checks if x is greater than 10, equal to 10, or less than 10, and prints an appropriate message for each case. Test your program with various values to x to ensure correct results for each case.

# Your solution for Question 1
x = 15
# Write your conditions here
# Question 2: Looping Over a List
# You are given a list of numbers. Write a Python program that loops through the list and prints whether each number is even or odd.

# Your solution for Question 2
numbers = [10, 21, 32, 43, 54]

# Write your loop here
# Question 3: Finding Words in a String
#You are given a sentence: "Python is fun and powerful". Write a Python program that checks whether the word "fun" or "boring" is in the sentence. Print different messages depending on whether the word is found or not. Be sure to test your program with different sentences to ensure correct results.

# Your solution for Question 3
sentence = 'Python is fun and powerful'

# Check for words 'fun' and 'boring'
#Question 4: Counting Occurrences in a List
#You are given a list of grades for students in a class:

grades = [85, 92, 78, 90, 92, 85, 92]
# Write a program that counts how many times each grade appears in the list and prints the results.

# Your solution for Question 4
grades = [85, 92, 78, 90, 92, 85, 92]

# Write your code to count occurrences
#Question 5: Looping Over a Dictionary
#You are given a dictionary that contains information about different countries and their populations in millions.

countries = {
    "Canada": 38,
    "Brazil": 212,
    "India": 1391,
    "Germany": 83,
    "Japan": 126
}

#Write a program that loops over the dictionary and prints the name of each country and its population. If the population is over 100 million, print a message saying the country is "heavily populated."

# Your solution for Question 5
countries = {
    'Canada': 38,
    'Brazil': 212,
    'India': 1391,
    'Germany': 83,
    'Japan': 126
}

# Write your loop here
