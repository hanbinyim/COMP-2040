# Task: Refactor the code by creating functions to avoid repetition.
# Think about creating separate functions for calculating the area of a rectangle and a circle.

# Calculating area of rectangles
length1 = 10
width1 = 5
area_rectangle1 = length1 * width1

length2 = 15
width2 = 7
area_rectangle2 = length2 * width2

# Calculating area of circles
radius1 = 4
area_circle1 = 3.14 * (radius1 ** 2)

radius2 = 6
area_circle2 = 3.14 * (radius2 ** 2)

print("Area of first rectangle:", area_rectangle1)
print("Area of second rectangle:", area_rectangle2)
print("Area of first circle:", area_circle1)
print("Area of second circle:", area_circle2)

# Refactored Code with Functions
# Function to calculate the area of a rectangle

def area_rectangle(length, width):
    return length * width

# Function to calculate the area of a circle
def area_circle(radius):
    return 3.14 * (radius ** 2)

# Calculating area of rectangles
area_rectangle1 = area_rectangle(10, 5)
area_rectangle2 = area_rectangle(15, 7)

# Calculating area of circles
area_circle1 = area_circle(4)
area_circle2 = area_circle(6)


print("Area of first rectangle:", area_rectangle1)
print("Area of second rectangle:", area_rectangle2)
print("Area of first circle:", area_circle1)
print("Area of second circle:", area_circle2)


# Task: Identify the repeating logic and refactor the code to use a function that checks 
# if a number is odd or even, and applies that function to any list of numbers.

# Check for odd or even numbers in list 1
numbers1 = [10, 15, 22, 29, 30]
for num in numbers1:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd.")

# Check for odd or even numbers in list 2
numbers2 = [1, 4, 7, 9, 12]
for num in numbers2:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd.")

# Check for odd or even numbers in list 3
numbers3 = [100, 150, 200]
for num in numbers3:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd.")

# Task: Refactor the code by creating a function that takes the price and discount as arguments and returns the final price. 
# Use the function to calculate the final prices for each customer, eliminating redundant code.

# Calculate discount for customer 1
price1 = 100
discount1 = 0.10
final_price1 = price1 - (price1 * discount1)

# Calculate discount for customer 2
price2 = 250
discount2 = 0.15
final_price2 = price2 - (price2 * discount2)

# Calculate discount for customer 3
price3 = 50
discount3 = 0.05
final_price3 = price3 - (price3 * discount3)

print(f"Final price for customer 1: ${final_price1}")
print(f"Final price for customer 2: ${final_price2}")
print(f"Final price for customer 3: ${final_price3}")
